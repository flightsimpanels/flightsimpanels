# TBM 900 Glareshield

This is a pretty accurate model of a TBM 900 glareshield. Its not as deep as the real one - only about 36 centimeter deep.

Below is the glareshield I built for myself. Its printed on a Prusa Mini+ in 15 parts. The parts has been glued together and the glareshield has be covered with leather imitation.
